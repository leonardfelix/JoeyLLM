High-Level Summary
These modules form the data loading and preprocessing pipeline for training a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically:

dataset.py defines a PyTorch Dataset class to efficiently stream and tokenize training samples from JSONL data files.

chunk.py contains logic for breaking long token sequences into manageable fixed-length chunks, enabling sequential training (e.g., with a transformer model).

test_data.py is a small test harness to preview how tokenized and chunked data would look when passed through the dataset, useful for debugging or inspection.

Together, these scripts prepare raw text data for ingestion by a transformer-based model, handling chunking, tokenization, and formatting into training-friendly inputs.


Detailed Module Breakdown
1. dataset.py — StreamingDataset for Efficient LLM Data Loading
Purpose: Implements a custom PyTorch Dataset class (StreamingDataset) that loads samples from a JSONL file and prepares them for LLM training.

Key Responsibilities:

Uses Hugging Face Tokenizer to convert raw text into token IDs.

Loads data from disk using jsonlines in streaming mode (memory-efficient for large datasets).

Uses the chunk_text function (from chunk.py) to segment long text into fixed-length input chunks.

Formats data into {input_ids, attention_mask} dictionaries suitable for training.

Key Functions:

StreamingDataset.__getitem__: Reads a line, tokenizes it, chunks the text, and returns a dict with input tensors.

Respects maximum chunk length (block_size) and manages truncation internally.

Dependencies:

Imports chunk_text from chunk.py.

2. chunk.py — Text Chunking Utility
Purpose: Breaks long token sequences into fixed-size overlapping/non-overlapping chunks.

Key Function:

chunk_text(token_ids, chunk_size=512): Splits a long list of token IDs into equal-sized chunks (default 512 tokens per chunk).

Returns a list of chunks for further processing (used in StreamingDataset).

Usage Context:

Called by StreamingDataset to turn each text line into one or more trainable input segments.

3. test_data.py — Data Loader Test Utility
Purpose: Tests the functionality of StreamingDataset and verifies chunking/tokenization outputs.

Key Responsibilities:

Loads tokenizer (AutoTokenizer) from Hugging Face.

Initializes the StreamingDataset with a given JSONL file and tokenizer.

Prints a sample of tokenized & chunked output (with decoded tokens) for inspection.

Key Steps:

Displays both raw token IDs and decoded text.

Useful for visual validation of data preprocessing before full training.

Dependencies:

Uses both dataset.py and chunk.py.

    dataset_py --> chunk_py
    test_data_py --> dataset_py
    test_data_py --> chunk_py
chunk.py is the utility layer used for breaking token sequences.

dataset.py builds on chunk.py, wrapping its logic into a PyTorch Dataset interface.

test_data.py serves as a testing harness that ties everything together to validate data processing.
