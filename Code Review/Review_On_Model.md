## Overall Impression
This codebase implements a clean, modular, and highly readable version of the GPT-2 model, closely matching Hugging Faceâ€™s architecture. It is well-organized, well-commented, and demonstrates good practices in model construction and weight loading.

## Strengths

**Modularity:**
Each part of GPT-2 (attention, block, model) is encapsulated into its own class. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

**Clarity and Documentation:**
The comments throughout the code are detailed and helpful, explaining not only what is happening but also why certain decisions are made (e.g., causal masking, transposition when loading weights).

**Compatibility:**
Special care is taken to match Hugging Faceâ€™s naming conventions and parameter structures. The load_hf_weights function is a thoughtful addition to make this model truly interchangeable with Hugging Face pretrained weights.

**Attention to Detail:**
Features like automatic causal mask generation, dropout application, and careful tensor reshaping for multi-head attention are handled correctly and consistently.

## Areas for Improvement
**Causal Mask Handling:**
In MultiHeadAttention, the causal mask is regenerated inside the forward pass every time. It would be more efficient to either cache it properly for different sequence lengths or pass it as an optional argument if known beforehand.

**Testing and Validation:**
There is no built-in testing code (e.g., small unit tests or a quick validation run). Adding a simple check (e.g., "can it successfully load a HF model and produce logits") would make the implementation more robust.

**Dynamic Input Handling:**
Currently, positional embeddings assume that the input sequence length will always fit within config.max_seq_len. Adding a check or automatic handling for longer inputs could improve usability.

## Conclusion
This is a high-quality and faithful reimplementation of GPT-2. The code is clean, modular, and well-aligned with best practices. Minor optimizations around efficiency and basic testing could make it even stronger, but overall it is a very solid and professional piece of work.
