# 🦘 JoeyLLM | Australia’s First Fair Dinkum AI Language Model  

G'day, mate! 🏄‍♂️ Welcome to **JoeyLLM**, the **next-gen Aussie AI** that speaks your language – whether it's English, Aussie slang, or even a bit of Strayan bush poetry.  

We’re on a mission to build **Australia’s first culturally and linguistically tailored large language model (LLM)**. Unlike your regular AI that doesn’t know the difference between a **bottle-o** and a **servo**, **JoeyLLM** will be trained on a rich dataset of Australian contexts, **including indigenous languages, regional slang, and local knowledge**.  

By the end of this project, we want **JoeyLLM to be the Steve Irwin of AI – smart, culturally aware, and ready to take on the world!** 🐊

## 🌏 Why JoeyLLM?  
Most AI models think "thongs" are flip-flops and that "football" means soccer. **Not on our watch!** 🚫⚽  

✅ **Understands Aussie Culture** – Indigenous languages, regional dialects, and why we shorten every word.  
✅ **Ethical AI** – No dodgy biases, just a fair go for all.  
✅ **Open Source** – Because AI should be shared like a good backyard barbie.  
✅ **Built for Australia** – Made for **industries, universities, and the community** (not just Silicon Valley).

## 🚀 Project Goals  
- Build a **scalable AI model** that doesn’t get confused when you say "Chuck a uey" 🛻  
- Publish **open-source datasets and research** (because we’re not gatekeepers)  
- Get **industry, academia, and everyday Aussies** involved in making AI actually useful Down Under

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation  
JoeyLLM is powered by state-of-the-art transformer architectures, just like GPT, **but with more Vegemite**. 🥪  

We focus on:  
- **High-quality Australian datasets** (yes, that includes regional footy banter)  
- **Fine-tuning for ethical AI** (we won’t teach it to call everything a "drop bear")  
- **Making it smart enough to handle real Australian language and culture**
