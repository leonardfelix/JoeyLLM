# 🦘 JoeyLLM | Australia’s Sovereign Foundational AI Model

**JoeyLLM** is an open-source, developer-led initiative to build **Australia’s first sovereign foundational language model (LLM)**—designed to reflect national values, understand local language, and serve long-term public and strategic interests.

This is not a fine-tuned version of an overseas model. JoeyLLM is **foundational infrastructure**—a homegrown base layer for AI innovation, national capability, and digital independence.

## 🇦🇺 Why JoeyLLM?

Today’s AI models are overwhelmingly developed offshore, trained on global data that doesn’t reflect Australian context, needs, or sovereignty. JoeyLLM is designed to change that.

- ✅ **Sovereign Capability** – A foundational model built, trained, and governed in Australia  
- ✅ **Culturally Aligned** – Incorporates Australian English, Indigenous languages, regional expressions, and public-domain Australian knowledge  
- ✅ **Open Source** – Transparent, auditable, and permissively licensed  
- ✅ **Trusted Infrastructure** – Built with a focus on safety, integrity, and national interest

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build an Australian foundational LLM using high-quality, diverse, and locally relevant datasets  
- Support downstream applications across research, public sector, education, and national industries  
- Release open-source training pipelines, datasets, and model checkpoints for auditability and reuse  
- Contribute to long-term sovereign digital capability through open infrastructure  

---

## 🧠 Technical Overview

JoeyLLM is built using modern transformer-based architectures, designed for performance, extensibility, and fine-tuning across multiple domains.

Focus areas include:

- Pretraining on Australian-relevant corpora and curated local knowledge  
- Training on secure, Australian-hosted compute infrastructure  
- Supporting downstream fine-tuning for health, education, legal, public sector, and more  
- Publishing model weights, code, and documentation for transparency and open science

## 🦘 A Sovereign *Foundational* Model with a National Mission

JoeyLLM is being developed to meet Australia’s strategic need for a **locally governed foundational model**—one that supports national resilience, trusted public-sector adoption, and innovation rooted in Australian values.

This is not just a model—it’s **foundational AI infrastructure** for a sovereign digital future.
